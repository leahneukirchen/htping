NAME
     htping – periodically send HTTP requests

SYNOPSIS
     htping [-4] [-6] [-H field:value] [-X method] [-c count] [-i interval]
            [-f] [-k] [--http1.1] [--keepalive] [-l addr] [-q] host

DESCRIPTION
     The htping utility periodically sends HTTP requests to host, prints the
     results and computes some statistics at exit.  Use Ctrl-C to quit htping.

     The options are as follows:

     -4      Use IPv4 only.

     -6      Use IPv6 only.

     -H field:value
             Add an additional HTTP header to the requests.

     -X method
             Send a different HTTP method than the default ‘HEAD’.

     -c count
             Stop after sending count requests.  By default, htping loops
             indefinitely.

     -i interval
             Perform one HTTP request every interval (default: ‘1s’).

     -f      Flood mode: perform requests back-to-back without waiting.

     -k      Turn TLS verification errors into warnings.

     --http1.1
             Disable HTTP/2 requests.

     --keepalive
             Enable keepalive resp. use persistent connections.

     -l addr
             Start a HTTP server at addr (e.g. ‘:9100’) to provide Prometheus
             metrics at ‘/metrics’.

     -q      Quiet mode, don't print request status lines.

EXIT STATUS
     The htping utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
